# CyberWise AI Advisor - Architecture Transformation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the successful transformation of the CyberWise AI Advisor from a monolithic component structure to a modular, scalable app-based architecture. The transformation enables better maintainability, parallel development, and easy addition of new security applications.

## Transformation Summary

### Before: Monolithic Structure
- Single dashboard with state-based navigation
- All components in a flat `src/components/dashboard/` structure
- Tightly coupled components
- Difficult to scale and maintain

### After: Modular App Architecture
- Three independent applications with React Router navigation
- Organized folder structure with clear separation of concerns
- Shared components, services, and utilities
- Scalable architecture ready for 5 additional apps

## New Architecture

### Folder Structure
